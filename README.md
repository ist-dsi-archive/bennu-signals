Bennu Signals
=============

This is a Signal Implementation for Bennu. It allows using an event based pattern to develop encapsulated blocks of code. This uses the [Guava EventBus](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/EventBusExplained) as the underlying event bus system. Bennu Signals operates outside the transactional environment of a given transaction, meaning that if objects are created or destroyed
